        <p>The first visualization is scatter plot with the relationship between the three antibiotic and the 16 bacterias.</p>
        <p>The goal of this visualization is being able to exam the most effective and least effective antibiotic for each of the bacteria. Here, color and position is encoded to perceive the data, and visualize it. Since we want to see which one is the most effective one for which bacteria. We use color to distinguish the three antibiotic, and scale their position base on different bacteria.</p>
        <p>Since it has the very big and very small number in the same y axis for a bacteria. I add the hover text explanation, so this way people can tell the specific number for the antibiotic.</p>
        <p>Also, from this graph, people are being able to see in general, which antibotic is more effective. The way how people can percieve it is from which color does the scatter point which is far away from the x-axis have the most.</p>

        <p>The  second one we want to examine effectiveness of antibiotic to bacteria that is negative. So we want to see the individual performance for each bacteria. So we could use grouped barchart. </br>
        The bar chart is grouped by the bacteria name. Then We also want to use different color to help reader to distinguish the different antibiotic. Since the distribution of the number is very large. So, here, we would also show text, so when people donâ€™t have to move their mouse to the bar, it will show this thing automatically.</p>

      <div class="descr">
        <p>The third one, we want to exam the effectiveness of specific antibiotic to negative and positive bacteria. So, we want to do a compare visualization. </br>So, we could first sort the data, separate the data into negative set and positive set. Then we want to use the scatter plot to see the contrast. Since position will be the easiest way for people to see the different and trends.We will use scatter plot here.</br>Also, by clicking different button, you can see different antibiotic effectiveness to the negative and positive bacteria. Also, we want to set the negative bacteria in purple, since it is the reaction they would show during the gram staining experiment.</p>
